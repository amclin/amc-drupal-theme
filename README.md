# amc-drupal-theme
Drupal theme used for [AnthonyMcLin.com](https://anthonymclin.com)

This is provided as an example for developing your own theme. It is highly-tailored for my site configurations and likely not usable out-of-box for yours.

To use:
  1. Clone the repo to your local environment.
  2. Run `npm install` to install Node dependencies.
  3. Run `npm run build` to compile the theme.
  4. Copy the entire resulting `dist/amc` folder into the `sites/all/themes/` folder in your Drupal installation so the final location is `sites/all/themes/amc/`
